	- collection efficiency for aggregation
		- not yet determined theoretically
		- observations:
			- open structures (e.g. dendrites) more likely stick to other ice crystals
			- sticking more likely at higher temperatures
		- significant aggregation only at T > -10 deg celsius

	- mass growth rate for aggregational growth
		dm/dt = E * w_i * pi * RÂ² * (v(R) - v(r))
			E: 		mean collection efficiency
			w_i:	cloud ice water content
			v:		fall speed of crystals/droplets
			R:		radius of collector crystal
			r:		radius of supercooled droplets
