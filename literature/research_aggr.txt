	- growth by aggregation
	- snowflakes formed by aggregation
	
	page 30:
	- dimensions of crystal [mm]
	
	page 33:
	- collection efficiency for aggregation
		- not yet determined theoretically
		- observations:
			- open structures (e.g. dendrites) more likely stick to other ice crystals
			- sticking more likely at higher temperatures
		- significant aggregation only at T > -10 deg celsius
	
	page 34:
	- mass growth rate for aggregational growth
		dm/dt = E * w_i * pi * R² * (v(R) - v(r))
			E: 		mean collection efficiency
			w_i:	cloud ice water content
			v:		fall speed of crystals/droplets
			R:		radius of collector crystal
			r:		radius of supercooled droplets

	- aggregation of ice crystals based on approach described in Lin et al. (1983)
	- collection efficiency depends on snow crystal size (Lohmann, 2004)
	- collection efficiency of accretion depends on temperature (Levkov et al., 1992)
	
	page 8:
	- major physical removal process of ice crystals in all simulations
		- order: 10 m-3s-1
		- about double the rate of accretion

	page 2:
	- mixed-phase clouds (MPC) thermodynamically unstable:
		- saturation vapor pressure (svp) over ice < over supercooled liquid water 
		- if environmental vapor pressure lies btw. svp of supercooled liquid water and ice:
			- ice crystals grow at expense of evaporating water droplets:
			  Wegener-Bergeron- Findeisen (WBF) process
		

UP_main_acp_20210826.pdf:
	page 5:
	- has two ice crystals sticking together -> forming a snowflake
	- differentiation with accretion (snowflake precipitate, ice crystals smaller and remain in cloud)

	page 11:
	- turning off aggregation has largest effect on model output
		- IWP doubled
		- CC increase
		- precipitation decrease
	- aggregation is removal process for ice crystals -> leads to increase of ice in atmosphere
	- IWP in ECHAM-HAM only counts ice crystals not snow

	page 12:
	- inhibition of aggregation inflicts similarly large increase in LWP as riming
		- aggr includes no direct interaction with liquid droplets
		- aggr acts as threshold process for CMP (accr, rim both need snowflakes)
		- when aggr turned off -> accr and rim consequently inhibited as well

	page 15:
	- aggr = dominant influence for most cloud variables (ICNC, ICC, LCC, CC, IWP, LCRE)

	page 16:
	- in Bacer et al. (2021): aggr contributes about twice as much as accr to ICNCs (self-collection has negligible role)
	- here: influence of aggr dwarfs that of accr in terms of sensitivity indices and process rates
	- explanation: slightly different model version, different tuning 

	page 20:
	- variables that had total sensitivity indices for aggr of over 0.7 (IWP, longwave/shortwave cloud
	  radiactive effect, CC, ICNC) -> dominant effect of aggr present on all length scales

	page 21:
	- in response to ECHAM-HAM inhibition of self-collection or accr negligible, while for riming and aggr
	  at least a less accurate representation can be appropriate
	- potential benefit in reduction of CPU time per model simulation
		- only about 0.2% of total computing time can be saved
		- in 10y simulation -> 1 more week of simulation (negligible in comparison to computing needed in model resolution)

	page 23:
	- ice crystal aggregation acts as a threshold process
		- phasing it causes model to deviate
		- when turned off: deviation immense
	- phasing of aggr most dominant impact by far (for model output)
	- shallow slope of response surface around default η_i = 1 hints that slight modifications of their representations
	  may leave model output unchanged (with PPE)
	- if one would want to make representation of one process more accurate: aggregation
	- simplifications to make model more interpretable, not cheaper
